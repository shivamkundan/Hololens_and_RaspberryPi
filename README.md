## Client Side

Our main development tool for creating objects for our mixed reality environment on the HoloLens was Unity version 5.6.3 p2 (patch 2). The shapes and outline of our buttons, the visible text placed in free space, and other assets were made available to us through unity. For this project, the user interface (UI) element was taken care of through unity development tool. Visual Studio works in concert with the Unity development tool as our script editor. This means that when it came to writing code for specific objects to perform an action, all of that was taken care of on the visual studio IDE.
